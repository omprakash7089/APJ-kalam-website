          <h2>Missile Man of india</h2>
          <p>
            <b> All Birds find shelter during a rain. </b>But an Eagle avoids
            rain by flying above the Clouds.” --Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. My
            favourite leader is an inspirational charm for the society. He has
            an everlasting confidence in his decisions and actions and he is
            never unsure about them. A good leader certainly inspires others and
            he has inspired me too. He is a role model for his followers
            including me and he always motivates them whenever possible. My
            favourite leader is a lot more than ‘just’ a leader! He is none
            other than Dr.Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, the missile man
            of India who is a moral and forever remembered leader born on 15
            October 1931 in a poor family in Tamil Nadu, Rameshwaram. Reasons
            are the pillars of the mind. The surprising fact is that the answer
            of ‘Why’ my favourite leader is Dr.APJ Abdul Kalam resides with him
            and in his books, mainly ‘My Journey’ and ‘REIGNITE’ which
            enlightened me to unbelievable extents. Each of his quotes speaks
            the utmost truth that help us in shining brighter than the sun. His
            Inspirational books such as “ Wings of Fire”, “ Ignited Minds” and “
            India 2020”, has become the tip of the tongue names to the youth of
            India because of the information and knowledge packed inside them!
            He encouraged children like us to dream big, to have a goal and
            achieve it. He taught us that education is the key to progress of
            our nation. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam is the perfect example to prove that
            ‘Success is not in what you have, but in who you are!’ Although he
            is a person with enormous success, he is a person with many more
            hearts! As he said, “I’m not a handsome guy, but I can my give
            hand-to-some one who needs help. Beauty is in the Heart, not in the
            face.” He was one distinct and honest person with exceptional
            qualities that India required. In my view, he taught us how honesty
            is the easiest thing we can practice in order to be happy,
            successful and fulfilled. Simplicity is one of the best things,
            which one can learn from his attributes. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam is a
            sincere patriot of his country and served as the 11th President of
            India from 2002 to 2007 and was known as the ‘People’s President’.
            He also played a key role in the success of Pokhran II (Pokhran 2)
            mission nuclear tests in 1998.
